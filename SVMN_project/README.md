## Building blocks

- **Open vSwitch (v2.7)**: open-source multi-layer virtual switch manager that allows the communication between "dumb switches" and controllers.
- **RYU (v4.34)**: component-based Software Defined Networking framework implemented in Python that provides a simple way to define control functionalities for an OpenFlow controller.
- **FlowVisor (v1.4)**: special purpose OpenFlow controller that acts as a transparent proxy between OpenFlow switches and multiple OpenFlow controllers.


## Implementation

![alt text](Implementation.png "Implementation")

- **Topology** (hosts and switches): defined in ComNetsEmu.
- **FlowVisor** (core controller): stands in between the switches and the tenant controllers; defines the slices to which one RYU controller is assigned each (enabling multi-tenancy); policy checks each OpenFlow message that goes through it, checking permissions related to the policies defined.
- **RYU controllers** (tenant controllers): defined in ComNetsEmu.

*Note*: FlowVisor v1.4 (last open-source version available) is based on OpenFlow 1.0, thus both the Open vSwitch switches and the RYU controllers need to be set up working with OpenFlow 1.0.

### Integrating FlowVisor in ComNetsEmu

Since FlowVisor is quite old and outdated, it needs to be implemented in a Docker container running an old CentOS image with an old version of Java (required by FlowVisor).
